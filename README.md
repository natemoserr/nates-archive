This project is a personal website I created for my INFSCI 1570 class.  
It has 5 pages: Home, About, Music, Travel, and Pets.  
The purpose of the site is to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while showing some of my interests.

## Pages
- **Home**: Intro page with a personal photo and tagline.  
- **About**: A short biography including my hobbies and a picture of me. 
- **Music**: A collection of my favorite records, with album art and a top 3 records table.  
- **Travel**: A collage-style gallery of recent trips with lightbox interactivity.  
- **Pets**: Pictures and descriptions of my 5 pets.

## HTML Elements
I used a variety of elements such as:  
- `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>` for structure.  
- `<ul>` and `<table>` for lists and organizing data.  
- `<img>` for images with alt text for accessibility.  
- `<div>` and `<span>` for styling.  

## CSS Styles
I created a consistent design by:  
- Styling the navigation bar, captions, and taglines.  
- Using `flexbox` and `grid` for layout.  
- Adding hover effects to links and styling text.  
- Making images uniform size for a clean layout.

## JavaScript
I added interactivity with JavaScript:  
- A **lightbox feature** on the travel page to enlarge photos.  
- Event listeners that modify styles (year auto-updates in the footer).
